            <h2>The God of Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Although Ganesha has many attributes, he is readily identified by his elephant head and four arms. He is widely revered, more specifically, as the remover of obstacles and bringer of good luck; the patron of arts and sciences; and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked during writing sessions as he bestows knowledge, prosperity, and success. His divine presence brings harmony, removes negativity, and guides devotees through life's challenges. He represents the perfect blend of strength, wisdom, and compassion that devotees seek in their spiritual journey.</p>
